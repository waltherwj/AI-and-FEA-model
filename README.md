# FEA and AI project

## Introduction

This project has as objectives to 

**1** - Implement a model of a tetrahedral element with many more degrees of freedom than a usual one, and create a dataset of load cases and solutions

**2** - With this model, train a neural network that emulates the model

**3** - Use the trained neural network to create a new element

### Bonus Objectives

**1** - Have the network itself impose new conditions on the model in an adversarial  way to ensure robustness

## Past Progress

## Current Work
Implementing a 2d model for proof of concept
